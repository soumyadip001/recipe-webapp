## Preview
See the demo here: [preview](https://sdh-foodmood.netlify.app/)

**NOTE:** Please note that this site is deployed to Netlify as a **static website**. Changes regarding the `/server` folder will not work. So all the API(s) will fail as expected. Please run this site locally in order to see the full functionality as search/pagination/recipe-details etc. But first, you need to create an API from [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty) and add the following env variables `SP_RapidAPI_Key` and `SP_RapidAPI_Host`. CHEERS!!!!

## Credits
This app design is heavily inspired by [dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/15223754-Food-Cooking-Inspiration-Website) but the layout is recreated completely using `Vue`, `tailwind` and `flexbox`. This app is created solely for **educational purposes** and **strictly not for sale!**.
